# Welcome

My name is BergIngwer07 and I´m working as an IT system engineer for a mid-sized software developer.

I´m focussing on DevOps topics e.g.
- Cloud Infrastructures (public & private clouds)
- Linux-based systems
- Automation with Configuration Management Tools like Ansible, Terraform or regular scripting with shell scripts

I also like customizing/ricing Arch Linux and MacOS to have nice workflows for my needs and make the UIs look like I want.
