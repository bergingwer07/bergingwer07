# Welcome

My name is BergIngwer07 and in the real life I´m working as an IT system engineer for a mid-sized software developer.

On my work I´m focussing on DevOps topics e.g.

- Cloud Infrastructures (public & private clouds)
- Linux-based systems
- Automation with configuration management tools like Ansible, Terraform or regular scripting with shell scripts

In my free time I also like customizing Arch Linux and MacOS to have nice workflows for my needs and make the UIs look like I want.
